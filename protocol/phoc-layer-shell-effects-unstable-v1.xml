      <description summary="Make layer_surface draggable">
        This marks a layer surface as draggable via one finger drag on touch or click and
        drag when using a mouse. E.g. a surface that is anchored to the left, right and
        top can be dragged to the bottom exposing more of it's surface.

        The state with the minimal amount of surface visible is called
        folded state, the state with the maximum amount of surface visible is
        called unfolded state. These two states are defined by the layer
        surfaces margin in those states. During drag the layer surfaces margin
        is adjusted to move the surface invalidating the margin set on the
        zwlr_layer_surface_v1 interface. The default folded and unfolded
        margins are 0.

        The threshold ([0.0, 1.0]) specifies how far the user needs to
        pull out the surface to not slide back into the folded state but
        rather slide into the unfolded state. The default is 1.0.

        The client is responsible for adjusting it's margins when it's
        size changes to e.g. make sure only the wanted parts of the surface
        are visible in folded state.

        Note that you shouldn't modify exclusive_zone or margins via
        zwlr_layer_surface_v1 interface directly when using this one.

        Margins, threshold and exclusive zone are double buffered and will
        be applied on the next surface commit.
