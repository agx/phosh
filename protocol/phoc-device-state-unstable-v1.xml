    <description summary="Device state information">
      Phones, tablets, convertibles, laptops can have additional hardware attached or switch
      their operation mode from e.g. tablet to laptop. This protocol is meant to provide information
      about these changes to interested clients.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

      This protocol is meant to collect necessary bits before we propose an
      upstream solution.
